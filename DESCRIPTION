Description: Implements the stopping-time coin-flip construction highlighted
    in a 2026 post on Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social
    Science (based on a short paper by Jim Propp): keep flipping until heads
    first outnumber tails, record the fraction of heads, and average over
    repeated runs. The package provides a chunked, vectorized implementation
    so large simulations can be run with bounded memory.
